  failure).  The Indemnified Party shall provide reasonable assistance to defend
  or settle an applicable claim at Indemnifying Party's expense.  The Parties

  not limited to changing the manner in which Applications communicate with the
  API, the RTE, the SDK and the Syntax. Deon Digital shall have no liability of
  any kind to Developer or any user of Developer's Applications with respect to
  such Modifications or any adverse effects resulting from such
  Modifications. Developer's continued access to or use of the Services or the
  API, the RTE, the SDK and the Syntax, following the Conformance Period shall
  constitute binding acceptance of the Modification(s) at issue.

  disclosure of Confidential Information that is legally compelled to be
  disclosed pursuant to a subpoena, summons, order or other judicial or

  order, or the like to the other Party so that such Party will have the
  opportunity to obtain a protective order or otherwise oppose the disclosure.
